## Phase 4: Current Work (Launch & Growth)

### Performance Optimization
- ✅ ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) configured for all pages (Dec 14)
- ✅ React Cache wrapper implemented for query deduplication (Dec 14)
- ✅ Cache times optimized based on data update frequency (6-24 hours)
- 🎯 Expected: 60-80% reduction in database queries, sub-100ms cached page loads
- **Key Learning**: Next.js 16 App Router doesn't pre-render pages at build time even with `generateStaticParams()` - ISR provides on-demand rendering with caching

### Google Indexing
- ✅ Sitemap submitted to Google Search Console
- ✅ Article schema on all product pages (replaced Product schema Dec 13)
- ⏳ Awaiting 1-4 weeks for full indexation (618 product pages)
- 🎯 Goal: Compete with 71k monthly visits benchmark

### External Link Building
- Reddit r/sharktank community engagement
- Product Hunt launch (after 50+ pages indexed)
- Social media presence (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)

### Weekly Episode Workflow
- Friday episode ingestion (new-episode.ts, update-deal.ts)
- Automated deal enrichment (daily cron at 10am UTC)
- Narrative refresh automation (3-hour batching with 1-hour cooldown)

### Monitoring & Operations
- Google Analytics 4 + Plausible tracking
- Vercel Cron: 3 automated jobs (episode detection, daily enrichment, narrative refresh)
- Cost monitoring: ~$3.82/month (OpenAI + Tavily)

### Future Enhancements
1. [ ] Product photo scraping/enrichment
2. [ ] PostHog analytics integration
3. [ ] Affiliate link management system
4. [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization
5. [ ] Email alerts for new episodes
6. [ ] Admin dashboard for content management
