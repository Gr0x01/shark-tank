        "content": "We collect only minimal data focused on understanding how visitors use our site. This includes anonymous analytics data such as page views, device type, and general location (like country or region). We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or any data that could directly identify you. There are no user accounts or sign-ups on our site, so we do not store any personal data."

        "heading": "Analytics and Tracking",
        "content": "To understand how people use tankd.io and improve your experience, we use two types of analytics tools. First, we use Plausible Analytics, a privacy-focused service that does not use cookies or collect personal data. It provides us with aggregate, anonymous insights without tracking you personally. Second, we also use Google Analytics (GA4) to gather standard website usage data. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information about your visit, such as how long you stay and which pages you view. You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by using browser add-ons or settings."

When you click these links, affiliate cookies may be placed on your device by those third parties to track qualifying purchases and help us earn commissions. These cookies are set and managed by the affiliate networks, not by us, and their use is subject to their own privacy policies. We do not collect any personal data through these affiliate cookies."

Each of these services has its own privacy policies governing how they collect and use data. We encourage you to review their policies to understand how your information is handled: Plausible Analytics (https://plausible.io/data-policy), Google Analytics (https://policies.google.com/privacy), Amazon Associates (https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/policies), and ShareASale (https://www.shareasale.com/affiliate-privacy-policy)."

You can browse tankd.io without being personally tracked by Plausible Analytics. For Google Analytics, you can opt out of tracking by using browser extensions or adjusting your browser settings. You can also clear or block affiliate cookies through your browser. If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), though our site does not meet the thresholds that trigger CCPA compliance requirements."
